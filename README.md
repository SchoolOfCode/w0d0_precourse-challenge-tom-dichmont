## Explanations and Learnings

I made a tribute page to Zinedine Zidane because I **love** him.

What I learnt:
- Zidane was a really good player, and possibly a **better** manager.
- I need more practice with Github. 
- The internet provides lots of useful guides for problem-solving specific issues that arise during web design.
- That a project based, applied learning model is the way to go.
- That practice makes perfect.

Thank you for reading
